## Compatibility

Originally designed and tested for ArcoLinux, ATT has broadened its scope to support other Arch-based systems. Here's a list of systems we aim to support:

| Distribution          | Website                    |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| ArcoLinux             | https://arcolinux.info     |
| Arch Linux (Vanilla)  | https://archlinux.org      |
| Alci                  | https://alci.online        |
| Carli                 | https://arcolinuxiso.com   |
| Ariser                | https://ariser.eu          |
| EndeavourOS           | https://endeavouros.com    |
| Garuda Linux          | https://garudalinux.org    |
| Manjaro               | https://manjaro.org        |
| XeroLinux             | https://xerolinux.xyz      |
| ArchLinux GUI (ALG)   | https://archlinuxgui.in    |
| Axyl                  | https://axyl-os.github.io  |
| RebornOS              | https://rebornos.org       |
| AmOS                  | https://github.com/amanre  |
| ArchCraft             | https://archcraft.io       |
| CachyOS               | https://cachyos.org        |

We face challenges not only in programming but also in understanding various distributions like EndeavourOS and Garuda. As we gain expertise, we will continue to add support for more Arch-based systems.

## Unsupported Distros/Desktops

Currently, there are no specific distributions that ATT is incompatible with. However, **ATT will never support the Sway window manager.**
